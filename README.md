# target_tracking

I've always been interested in object tracking and the statistics in the uncertainty estimations surrounding it, so I felt this would be an interesting project for me. The goal is to eﬃciently track objects through occlusion by improving upon the Circulant- Matrix (CM) tracker. The CM tracker works by computing convolutions based on information from previous frames. These convolutions are determined by applying a ﬁlter on a predeﬁned subsection of the image and calculating the peak response from frame to frame using the Fast Fourier Transform of a larger which contains the object in the current frame. However, the CM tracker handles target tracking very poorly both during target occlusion and in recovering after occlusion. In order to implement occlusion detection we will implement an algorithm to calculate the Peak to Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) to compare the ﬁlter response against the rest of the designated search area. This allows us to determine a threshold, such that if the PSR is below a speciﬁed value, indicates that there is occlusion of the target. Once we are able to determine where (pixel coordinates) and when (frame number) the occlusion occurred, we canp proceed to extrapolate the general position and direction of the target. After occlusion has been detected, it is important to ensure that the system can accurately recover the target in a timely manner. This involves predicting where the target is during occlusion using information about the target pre-occlusion. We will use a Kalman ﬁlter to integrate this information over time, and assume a constant velocity model to make an accurate estimate of target position.

It works through occlusion!
